# meta-geofetch
## Introduction
meta-geofetch is a bioinformatics semi-automatic pipeline to fetch metadata from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.
This tool is particularly useful when planning a complex analysis with various samples. Especially if:
- Samples are retreived using a variety of keywords
- Data needs to be inspected/filtered for sample selection

Additionally, this improves geofetch Python package for Mac users (see below).

## Usage

```python meta_geofetch.py```  
```Enter GEO search query: [your_GEO_query]```  
```Enter organism name (for filtering, optional): [latin organism name]```  
```Enter assay type (for filtering, optional): [i.e. ChIP-seq]```  
```Enter target string in sample_name (for filtering and renaming the metadata directory)```


This generates a list of GSEs from given GEO search query and writes it to metadata.txt  
metadata.txt is then processed, retrieving metadata of files associated with given GSEs.
Metadata then might be filtered using provided filters and concatenated into one file.


## Requirements
``` conda create -f environment.yml```  
``` conda activate meta_geofetch```
